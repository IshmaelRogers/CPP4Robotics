Introduction

C++ is used in a variety of industry robotics applications. It is an object oriented, compiler based programming language that allows developers to represent real world objects as classes in a program. 

One of the key advantages of C++ is its runtime speed. Being a compiler based programming language means that the program first evaluates every line in the code and then begins executing commands. 

Using C++ in ROS packages is convienent because most ROS nodes are written in C++ and only need minor modifications.

In order to use physical hardware such as sensors or actuators, device drivers are need and are often compiled in C++.
C++ is great for digging deep into the lower level controls when designing a robot.
